## PriorityQueue ##
The PriorityQueue is based on the binary heap. 
The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to the natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used.  

A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with the heap property, either Min Heap or Max Heap.
Min Heap: the value at the root must be minimum among all values present in Binary Heap. Max Heap is the opposite.
Time complexity of most opererations: O(log N)

PATCH VS PUT:
  PATCH is used to apply partial updates to a resource, meaning that only the fields that need to be changed are sent in the request body. 
  PUT is used to replace the entire resource with a new representation, meaning that all the fields of the resource are sent in the request body, even if they are not modified.

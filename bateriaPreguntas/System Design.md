A system design interview is usually composed of 5 steps:

Step 1: Understand the problem. Get to know the problem and define the scope of the design.

Step 2: Design the system.  Outline the most essential parts of the system and show how they work together to achieve the desired function.

Step 3: Explore the design. You or your interviewer will choose an interesting component and discuss its details.

Step 4: Improve the design. Consider the current design's issues and how to fix them and support more users.

Step 5: Wrap up. Check that the design meets all requirements and suggest ways to improve it.

Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
Horizontal scaling refers to increasing the capacity by adding additional machines. -> Harder to maintain, but improves fault tolerance.
Vertical scaling refers to increasing the resources of existing machines. -> Easier to maintain, but there is a limit to it, and also there is a single point of failure

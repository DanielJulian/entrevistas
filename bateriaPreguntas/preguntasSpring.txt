Spring is a framework focused on the inversion of control principle. To achieve this it uses the dependency Injection pattern.
Because of this, it makes it easy to develop loosely coupled applications. It makes applications testable.

Spring Boot
	Spring based applications have a lot of configuration. When we use Spring MVC, we need to configure component scan, dispatcher servlet, a view resolver, web jars(for delivering static content) among other things. 	        When we use Hibernate/JPA, we would need to configure a datasource, an entity manager factory, a transaction manager among a host of other things. 
	Spring Boot can auto configure some beans automatically
	
	Spring boot provides:
	Starters - convenient dependencies that package everything we need for certain scenarios
	Auto config
	Production ready - Actuator dependency provides production ready features: Endpoints for health check, beans, etc
	                                                                           Observability - Logging, metrics, tracing

Spring MVC 
	Provides a decoupled way of developing web applications, separating the model, the view and the controller(a.k.a dispatcher servlet)


Questions:
	- Q: Let's say I have a class that I don't own because its in an external library, how do I inject an instance of that class into the ApplicationContext?
	  A: We create a class with the @Configuration annotation. Inside that class, we create a method that returns an instance of the class we want to inject, and we mark the method
             with the @Bean annotation. @Bean indicates that a method produces a bean that will be managed by the Spring Container. The name of the bean wil be the method name
